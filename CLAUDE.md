# CLAUDE.md — working agreement for website-personal

Standing instructions for any Claude / AI assistant making changes in this repository — a React +
TypeScript personal website bundled by webpack. This file is committed to git so it travels with the
code and is loaded automatically at the start of every session in this folder.
**Follow every rule below on every change, without being reminded**, wherever you are running.

The governing principle: **maximum compile-time certainty, enforced automatically.** A mistake this
repo can catch before the code runs should be impossible to commit, and catching it should require no
human vigilance. Prefer a gate that fails the build over a convention someone has to remember.

## The rules

Apply all of these to every non-trivial change, as part of "done" — not optional polish.

### 1. Component purity — props in, markup out

A presentational component takes props and renders markup. It does not fetch data, read the router, reach
for globals, or know where it sits in the page. Composition happens at the page level, where the concrete
data, routes, and copy are assembled and passed down. A component that reaches outward is harder to test,
harder to reuse, and harder to reason about; one that only reads its props is none of those things.

**Type props as deeply readonly.** Props are the component's contract, and a component must never mutate
them. `readonly` on every field, `readonly T[]` for every array — see
[`HeaderProps.ts`](src/website/Header/HeaderProps.ts) for the shape. This is not decoration: oxlint's
`prefer-readonly-parameter-types` enforces it, and the compiler makes a violation unrepresentable.

**Keep the variant out of the invariant.** When a component is genuinely reusable, it should hold no copy,
no routes, and no site-specific layout — those belong to the page composing it. When it is genuinely
page-specific, leave it there rather than promoting it to a generality it does not have. Do not manufacture
abstraction layers this site's size does not justify. If the line is unclear, that is a rule-5 trade-off:
surface it rather than guess.

### 2. Refactor, don't bolt on

Favor refactoring toward the right design even when it is a lot of work. Match the surrounding patterns and
naming. Do not paper over a design problem with a local patch when the clean fix is a refactor.

### 3. Zero warnings — the build is the gate

Leave **no** type errors, **no** lint errors, and **no** warnings. The gate is real and automatic:

| Layer | Enforces | Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tsc` | Full type safety at maximum strictness | [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json) |
| `oxlint` + `tsgolint` | Type-aware lint rules, plus compiler diagnostics | [`.oxlintrc.json`](.oxlintrc.json) |
| `prettier` | Formatting | [`.prettierrc.js`](.prettierrc.js) |
| `markdownlint` | Markdown | [`.markdownlint.json`](.markdownlint.json) |

`tsconfig.json` runs every strictness flag TypeScript offers, not just `strict: true`. `skipLibCheck` is
**off**, so dependency types are checked too. `erasableSyntaxOnly` is load-bearing: Babel strips types without
consulting a typechecker, so `enum`, `namespace`, and parameter properties would compile and then break at
runtime — that flag makes them impossible.

`.oxlintrc.json` runs `correctness`, `suspicious`, `perf`, and `pedantic` as **errors**, with `typeAware`,
`typeCheck`, and `denyWarnings` on. The `style` and `restriction` categories are deliberately off: they
enforce taste, not correctness, and buy churn instead of protection.

**Fix the cause, not the symptom.** Prefer changing the code over disabling the rule. When a rule genuinely
does not apply, disable it as narrowly as possible — scoped to a file via `overrides` rather than globally —
and write the justification as a comment next to it. `.oxlintrc.json` accepts comments; every deviation there
carries its reason. `reportUnusedDisableDirectives` is an error, so stale suppressions cannot accumulate
silently.

**Never reach for `--fix-suggestions` or `--fix-dangerously` inside the build.** Both may change program
behavior, and a linter that silently rewrites semantics on every build is a hazard, not a convenience. They
live in `npm run lint:fix`, run deliberately and reviewed.

### 4. Docs — update them with the change

Docs ship with the change, never as a follow-up. [`README.md`](README.md) is the guide for a human running or
building the site. This file is the working agreement. Every fact lives in exactly one place. Markdown must
pass `npm run docs`.

**Write docs to be read, not decoded — clarity beats brevity.** The goal is prose an engineer new to the code
can follow on the first pass, not the fewest possible words. Concision is a virtue only up to the point where
it starts hiding meaning; past it, a "dense" sentence is a defect, not a flourish. Specifically:

- **One thought per sentence.** If a sentence chains a whole pipeline or decision tree through arrows,
  semicolons, em-dashes, and stacked parentheticals, it is doing too much — break it into several short
  sentences. More than one nested parenthetical, or more than about 35 words, is a smell.
- **Use structure for structured content.** A sequence of steps is an ordered list; a set of independent
  things is a bullet list or a table — not a run-on sentence with separators. Reserve inline prose for
  genuine narrative ("why", "how it fits").
- **Parentheticals are the exception, not the sentence.** A clause important enough to keep belongs in its
  own sentence; if it is not important enough for that, cut it. Never nest them.
- **Keep the facts, drop the compression.** Rewriting for clarity must not delete technical content or move a
  fact to a second location — it re-shapes the *same* information into readable form.

**Document the present, not the past.** Docs describe what the code does *now* — never what it used to do, how
it changed, or how to migrate from an older design. No "breaking changes", "previously", "the old behavior",
or before/after narration; that history lives in git. Write every behavioural caveat as a present-tense fact
about how the code works today.

### 5. Ask the user on trade-off decisions

When a task involves a genuine choice — an architecture or design decision with real trade-offs, an ambiguous
requirement, or more than one reasonable approach — **ask before committing to a direction** rather than
guessing. Lay out the options and their trade-offs concisely (a recommendation plus the alternatives) and let
the user decide. This matters most for choices that are expensive to reverse: dependencies, public component
APIs, build-pipeline structure, and cross-cutting patterns. For low-stakes or clearly conventional choices,
pick the sensible default, state it, and move on — do not stall on trivia.

### 6. Document by contract

Every exported type, component, function, and hook carries a TSDoc comment: a summary, plus `@param` for each
parameter and `@returns` where the return is not self-evident. Write them **by contract**, not as narration.
State the **preconditions** a caller must satisfy, the **postconditions** the member guarantees, and the
**invariants** it holds. Document what the signature cannot show — side effects, valid ranges, "call once",
ownership, what throws and when. Never restate the member's name or its parameter types.

The type system carries most of the contract here, so a doc comment that merely repeats the types is noise.
Write one when there is something the signature cannot say.

### 7. Keep dependencies current — but verify, never trust

Run `npm run update` (`ncu -u --peer`) to bump dependencies, then **always** run the full build before
believing it. Dependency updates in this repo have a track record of breaking in non-obvious ways, and the
tooling will not warn you:

- **`ncu` ignores peer-dependency ranges, even with `--peer`.** It bumps to the newest published version
  regardless of whether the rest of the tree can accept it. Verified, not assumed.
- **A stale `package-lock.json` produces misleading `ERESOLVE` errors.** npm reports the first collision it
  finds against the old tree, which is often not the real conflict. When an install fails after a version
  bump, delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and install clean before diagnosing anything.
- **`npm install --force` / `--legacy-peer-deps` do not fix peer conflicts.** They install a tree that cannot
  work and defer the failure to runtime. The tell is a nested duplicate package under
  `node_modules/<pkg>/node_modules/`.

TypeScript is pinned to `7.x` and lint runs on oxlint precisely because `typescript-eslint` cannot support
TypeScript 7 — TS 7 is the Go compiler, and its npm package no longer exports the compiler API that
typescript-eslint is built on. Do not reintroduce `eslint` or `typescript-eslint` here.

### 8. Updating these instructions

If you change how work is done here — these rules, or the equivalent home-folder memories — you **must**:
(a) **notify the user explicitly** that the instructions changed; (b) update **this file** (it is committed and
portable); and (c) update the home-folder memory copy if it is accessible. Keep the two in sync.
**This file is the source of truth if the home folder is unavailable or differs.**

## Definition of done

- [ ] Components stay pure — props in, markup out; props typed deeply `readonly`.
- [ ] Refactored toward the right design, not bolted on.
- [ ] Exported members documented by contract (TSDoc: preconditions, postconditions, invariants).
- [ ] Rule deviations fixed at the cause; any suppression is narrowly scoped and carries its justification.
- [ ] `npm run build` is green: lint, format, docs, typecheck, and bundle.
- [ ] Behavior that the type system cannot prove was exercised by hand in a browser.
- [ ] README updated if behavior a human relies on changed; markdownlint passes.
- [ ] Committed only if the user asked (branch first if on the default branch).

## Where config lives

| Concern | Home |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript strictness (the primary correctness gate) | [`tsconfig.json`](tsconfig.json) |
| Lint rules, categories, plugins, type-aware options | [`.oxlintrc.json`](.oxlintrc.json) |
| Formatting | [`.prettierrc.js`](.prettierrc.js) |
| Markdown rules | [`.markdownlint.json`](.markdownlint.json) |
| Bundling, loaders, output | [`webpack.config.js`](webpack.config.js) |
| Babel presets (transpile only — never typechecks) | [`.babelrc`](.babelrc) |
| Line endings (LF everywhere, enforced on checkout) | [`.gitattributes`](.gitattributes) |

## Repo facts

- **React 19 + react-router 7**, bundled by **webpack 5**, transpiled by **Babel 8**. Babel strips types
  without checking them, so `tsc` is the only thing standing between a type error and production.
- **TypeScript 7** (the Go compiler). `tsc` is typecheck-only: `noEmit` is set, and webpack owns the bundle.
- **oxlint + oxlint-tsgolint** provide type-aware linting. There is no ESLint in this repo, by design.
- **Run:** `npm start` (builds, then serves). **Build:** `npm run build`.
- `npm run build` runs, in order: `lint` → `format` → `docs` → `typecheck` → `webpack`. Every step is a gate;
  the build fails on the first one that does.
- **There is no test suite, by design.** Correctness here rests entirely on the compile-time gate, so a
  behaviour the type system cannot prove is a behaviour nothing verifies. Exercise such changes in a browser
  before calling them done, and be correspondingly conservative in code the compiler cannot check.
- **No i18n, no logging framework, no state manager.** These are deliberate absences, not oversights. Do not
  add one without asking (rule 5).
